# `main.js`

## Role in the System
Bundled client-side JavaScript served to Journey Builder. Generated by webpack from `src/index.js` (and dependencies such as `postmonger`). Provides the runtime behavior for the inspector UI.

## Composition

* Includes third-party libraries (`postmonger`) and project scripts transpiled for browser compatibility.
* Output of the webpack build defined in `webpack.config.js`; should not be edited manually.

## Usage

* Served statically by `app.js` (`/main.js`) and referenced in `index.html`.
* Regenerated via `npx webpack --mode=<mode>` or `npm run dev` during development.

## Troubleshooting

* **Outdated behavior** – Rebuild using webpack to incorporate recent source changes.
* **Large file size** – Run webpack in production mode to enable minification.
* **Source debugging** – Leverage `main.js.map` for readable stack traces in modern browsers.

## Glossary

* **Bundle** – Aggregated and transpiled JavaScript file produced from multiple source modules.
* **Source Map** – Companion file (`main.js.map`) that maps bundle code back to original source for debugging.
