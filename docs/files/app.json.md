# app.json

## Role in the System
Describes the application for Heroku’s App Manifest specification, enabling one-click deployments and review apps with predefined metadata and buildpacks.

## Public Interface
| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name`, `description` | Human-readable details shown in Heroku dashboards or the Elements marketplace. |
| `repository` | Points to the GitHub repository containing the source code. |
| `keywords` | Tags that describe the application domain. |
| `buildpacks` | Specifies `heroku/nodejs` to build the Node.js application. |

## Key Parameters and Return Values
Not applicable; JSON metadata consumed by the Heroku platform.

## External Dependencies
* Requires the Heroku platform to interpret the manifest when provisioning apps.

## Data Flow
Influences how Heroku sets up the runtime environment (Node.js buildpack) and documents the app in dashboards. Does not affect runtime execution directly.

## Error Handling and Edge Cases
* Ensure the repository URL remains accurate; otherwise, Heroku one-click deployments will fail.
* Update the `keywords` and description as features evolve for clearer documentation.

## Usage Example
To deploy via the Heroku Platform API or the dashboard, supply `app.json` as part of the configuration when creating the app. No command-line invocation is required beyond standard Heroku workflows.

## Related Files
* `Procfile` – Defines the process executed after buildpack installation.
* `package.json` – Provides scripts and dependencies resolved by the Node.js buildpack.

## Troubleshooting
| Issue | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| Heroku one-click deploy fails | Verify the repository URL is accessible and contains a valid Node.js project. |
| Buildpack mismatch errors | Confirm `heroku/nodejs` is still appropriate for the application runtime. |

## Glossary
* **App Manifest** – JSON file that describes an application’s configuration for automated provisioning on Heroku.
